# Lab 5 - Backend API

In the previous lab, a LangChain agent was created armed with tools to do vector lookups and concrete document id lookups via function calling. In this lab, the agent functionality needs to be extracted into a backend api for the frontend application that will allow users to interact with the agent.

Please visit the lab repository to complete this lab.
